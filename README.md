### RIZAL YALA PARADHIKA 

I like programming since junior high school, because for me programming is fun, interesting, and sharpens my brain. To be more precise, I make website projects from Django, because of its flexibility and ease. Moreover, now there is AI technology so I just order what I want, take the convenience but learn hard, never be fooled by automatic systems. Use them for profit
